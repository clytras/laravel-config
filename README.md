# LytraX JS/TS library

## Development

- Commit changes to GitHub using [commitizen][commitizen] `git cz`

## Publish

Always commit everything before publishing new releases.

1. `yarn build` to build the distribution files
2. `yarn deploy` or `np --contents=release` to bump version, run release script and publish to NPM and GitHub

Running `np` will have the `version` script executed which will run the `makeRelease` script.
